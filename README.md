# Project created with nextjs 
This project is a Pro challenge from (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/audiophile-ecommerce-website-C8cuSd_wx)


I worked on this project to try out the nextjs framework.

This project is still a work in progress, and it may not function correctly on devices with lower screen resolutions. Currently, it's optimized for my computer's high-resolution screen. I haven't implemented all the necessary media queries to ensure responsiveness across various devices (i know i should have done it from the start but i was focusing on working with the nextjs framework, now it's too much to deal with and im lazy to do so, but i'm definitely gonna do it later on tho).
